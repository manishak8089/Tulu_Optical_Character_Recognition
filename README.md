## _Tulu Manuscript OCR: Preserving Ancient Wisdom Through Character Recognition_
### Project Overview

*This project aims to address the scarcity of efficient OCR solutions for the Tulu language, which is spoken in coastal Karnataka. By using machine learning algorithms, we built an OCR system that can accurately recognize Tulu characters from manuscript images. The model was trained using a dataset of augmented Tulu characters and achieved an accuracy of 92.35% using the Random Forest algorithm.*

### Project Workflow

**1. Dataset Preparation**

_The dataset for this project consisted of A4 sheets containing handwritten Tulu characters arranged in a 6x9 table format. These sheets were scanned and saved as images, forming the base of our dataset. The total number of sheets was 112, each containing 54 characters. This provided a solid foundation for building our Tulu Manuscript OCR system._

_You can imagine the dataset as a collection of scanned pages, where each character was neatly written in individual cells of the table, which allowed for clear segmentation and character extraction._
