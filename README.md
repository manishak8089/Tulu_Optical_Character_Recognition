## _Tulu Manuscript OCR: Preserving Ancient Wisdom Through Character Recognition_
**Project Overview**

*This project aims to address the scarcity of efficient OCR solutions for the Tulu language, which is spoken in coastal Karnataka. By using machine learning algorithms, we built an OCR system that can accurately recognize Tulu characters from manuscript images. The model was trained using a dataset of augmented Tulu characters and achieved an accuracy of 92.35% using the Random Forest algorithm.*
